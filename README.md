phplist-plugin-subjectLinePlaceholdersPlugin
>>>>>>> Polishing-Code
===================================

A plugin to allow conditional placeholders in phplist messages, including in the subject line.
If there is no value for certain text containing the placeholder, alternate text is inserted into the message.

This version works, but some areas of the code are pretty clumsy and need cleaning up. This is the first cut at the problem; it will be followed soon by a second release.
